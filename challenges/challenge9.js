/*
Example: [17, 21, 23] will print "... 17째C in 1 days ... 21째C in 2 days ... 23째C in 3 days ..."

Create a function 'printForecast' which takes in an array 'arr' 
and logs a string like the above to the console

Use the problem-solving framework: Understand the problem and break it up into sub-problems

TEST DATA 1: [17, 21, 23]
TEST DATA 2: [12, 5, -5, 0, 4]

1) understanding the problem
    - array transformed to string, seperated by '...'
    - what is the x days? answer: index + 1

2) breaking up into sub-problems
    - transform array into string
    - transform each element to string with 째C
    - strings need to contain day (index + 1)
    - add ... between elements at start and end of string
    - log string to console
*/

const data1 = [17, 21, 23];
const data2 = [12, 5, -5, 0, 4];

const printForecast = function (arr) {
  let str = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    str += `${arr[i]} in ${i + 1} days ... `;
  }
  console.log("... " + str);
};

printForecast(data1);
